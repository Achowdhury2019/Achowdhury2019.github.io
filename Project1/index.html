    <h1>Iceland</h1>
    <p><i><b>Iceland</b></i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where incular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        <h1>About the Northern Lights</h1>
        <p>The Aurora Borelis takes its name from Roman goodess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atomoshpere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

        <h1>About the Glacier</h1>
        <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik(and Skaftafell).</p>
