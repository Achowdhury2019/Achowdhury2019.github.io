      Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is
      surrounded by some of Iceland’s most grand volcanoes and during
      summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to
      the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get
      in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
