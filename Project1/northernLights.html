      <i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or northern lights, begin high in
      the Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when
      charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic
      field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.

      The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
      Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in
      these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene,
      consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light
      pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.

      In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter
      nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March
      and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles
      interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest the
      autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in
      polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a
      sky guide app.
